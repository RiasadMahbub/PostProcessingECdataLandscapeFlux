## Introduction and instruction links

This is an R Markdown document. In this document we are trying to compile the information of the landscape flux 2018-2023 data for AmeriFlux submission. The guidelines for this submission can be obtained from these links:

- [YTvideo AMP webinar series: Submitting BADM in CSV format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dyG6OMnfdM&t=11s)
- [YTvideo AMP webinar series: Post-submission data life cycle: FP-In to BASE publishing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS95r9JbbB0&t=2336s)
- [AmeriFlux submission instructions](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/data/badm/badm-submission-instructions/#)
- [AmeriFlux Data Submission PDF](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191026-AMF-Data-Submission-HChu.pdf)
- [AmeriFlux Variable Information Instructions](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/variable-information/variable-information-instructions/)
- [Uploading Half-Hourly/Hourly Data to AmeriFlux](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/data/uploading-half-hourly-hourly-data/)



## Location of the files
The location of the data can be obtained from these directories. Shared directory is the directory of the landscape flux group where the data are kept. The data were copied from the shared directory to local directory (rbmhabub's computer) to do the processing of the data

In shared directory: 

Way3 Directory: "Y:/Rice/MasterFileSets/Way3/2021_11_20" 

Way4 Directory: "Y:/Rice/MasterFileSets/Way4/2021_11_20" 

In local directory:


Way3 Directory: "C:/Users/rbmahbub/Documents/RProjects/AmerifluxDataSubmission_LandscapeFlux/Data/Way3" 

Way4 Directory: "C:/Users/rbmahbub/Documents/RProjects/AmerifluxDataSubmission_LandscapeFlux/Data/Way4" 



```{r }
## read the files
# Set the directory path and file name
directory_path <- "C:/Users/rbmahbub/Documents/RProjects/AmerifluxDataSubmission_LandscapeFlux/Data/Way3"
file_name <- "Way3 2018.csv"
file_path <- file.path(directory_path, file_name)

# Read the CSV file
way3_2018_data <- read.csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the data
head(way3_2018_data)
```

## Saving the files 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(way3_2018_data$SW_IN_Avg)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Guidelines from the video:

1. Do support list of common variable names (From the table)<br>
2. Use the exact variable names and the units <br>
3. Very first on the list, what to do with the data, remove the known values  <br>
4. U-star filtering of the data  <br>
5. CSV is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values  <br>
6. The first two column are TIMESTAMP_START and TIMESTAMP_END (ISO time format: YYYYMMDDHHMM e.g., 201810220930)  <br>
7. Dont convert the scientific notations in timestamps  <br>
8. An hour column to check the data
